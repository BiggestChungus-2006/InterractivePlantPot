# AI Plant Pot (Smart Horticulture System) - [Work in Progress]

### Project Overview
An IoT-based system designed to automate plant care using ESP32 microcontrollers. The goal is to integrate soil moisture sensors with a local AI model to predict watering schedules based on environmental data.

### Tech Stack
* **Hardware:** ESP32, Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT11 (Temp/Humidity)
* **Software:** MicroPython / C++ (Arduino IDE)
* **Connectivity:** MQTT / WiFi

### Current Status (Jan 2026)
* ✅ Hardware assembly and sensor interfacing (Completed)
* 🚧 AI Model integration for watering logic (In Progress)
* 🚧 Power optimization for battery usage (In Progress)

### Next Steps
* Implementing the sleep mode logic to extend battery life.
* Finalizing the dataset for the prediction model.
